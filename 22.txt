RollingBacks:

    first solution: change deployment file and recreate it (not delete it)
    second solution: change with below command 
            kubectl set image [deployment names] [container names]=[new images names]
    example:kubectl set image deployment.app/first-deployment nginx=httpd

    third solution: 
        1=>kubectl edit [deployment names]
        2=>kubectl rollout status [deployment names]


show deployment revision count and number: kubectl rollout history [deployment names]
See current revision number : you can see in describe deployment in Annotations part
undo rollout deployment: kubectl rollout undo [deployment names] --to-revision=[number]


Scaling a Deployment
    You can scale a Deployment by using the following command:

    kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10


    kubectl autoscale deployment/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80


CHANGE-CAUSE content for the current revision:
    kubectl annotate deployments.apps my deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="some causes"




Checking Rollout History of a Deployment
Follow the steps given below to check the rollout history:

First, check the revisions of this Deployment:

kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
The output is similar to this:

deployments "nginx-deployment"
REVISION    CHANGE-CAUSE
1           kubectl apply --filename=https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
2           kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
3           kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.161

CHANGE-CAUSE is copied from the Deployment annotation kubernetes.io/change-cause to its revisions upon creation. You can specify theCHANGE-CAUSE message by:

Annotating the Deployment with kubectl annotate deployment/nginx-deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="image updated to 1.16.1"
Manually editing the manifest of the resource.
To see the details of each revision, run:

kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment --revision=2
The output is similar to this:

deployments "nginx-deployment" revision 2
  Labels:       app=nginx
          pod-template-hash=1159050644
  Annotations:  kubernetes.io/change-cause=kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
  Containers:
   nginx:
    Image:      nginx:1.16.1
    Port:       80/TCP
     QoS Tier:
        cpu:      BestEffort
        memory:   BestEffort
    Environment Variables:      <none>
